# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

## Definition

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. - Arthur Samuel, 1959

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data
2. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Select and create features
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithms
5. **Training**: Teach the model using training data
6. **Evaluation**: Test the model's performance
7. **Deployment**: Use the model for predictions

## Real-World Applications

- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix, Amazon, Spotify
- **Image Recognition**: Facebook photo tagging, medical imaging
- **Natural Language Processing**: Siri, Alexa, Google Translate
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Self-driving cars
- **Financial Services**: Fraud detection, credit scoring

## The Learning Process

Machine learning models learn by:
- Finding patterns in historical data
- Generalizing these patterns to new data
- Improving performance through experience

## Types of Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Learning without labels
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction

We'll explore these types in detail in the next lesson.
