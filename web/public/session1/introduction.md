# Introduction to Machine Learning

Welcome to the Building Machine Learning Systems course! This session will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of machine learning.

## What You'll Learn

- Basic concepts and terminology
- Types of machine learning problems
- The machine learning workflow
- Tools and frameworks

## Getting Started

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

### Key Concepts

1. **Data**: The foundation of any ML project
2. **Features**: Characteristics or attributes of the data
3. **Labels**: The target variable we want to predict
4. **Model**: The algorithm that learns patterns from data
5. **Training**: The process of teaching the model
6. **Testing**: Evaluating the model's performance

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of statistics
- Familiarity with data structures
