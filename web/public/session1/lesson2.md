# Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning can be categorized into three main types based on the learning approach and the nature of the data.

## 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the correct answers are provided.

### Characteristics
- Uses labeled training data
- Goal is to predict outcomes for new data
- Examples: classification, regression

### Common Algorithms
- **Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous values
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification
- **Decision Trees**: Both classification and regression
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method
- **Support Vector Machines**: Classification and regression

### Example Applications
- Predicting house prices
- Spam email detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Credit card fraud detection

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled responses.

### Characteristics
- Uses unlabeled data
- Goal is to discover structure in data
- Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction

### Common Algorithms
- **K-Means Clustering**: Grouping similar data points
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Tree-based clustering
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction
- **Autoencoders**: Neural network-based dimensionality reduction

### Example Applications
- Customer segmentation
- Image compression
- Anomaly detection
- Market basket analysis

## 3. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by taking actions in an environment.

### Characteristics
- Learning through interaction
- Goal is to maximize cumulative reward
- Examples: game playing, robotics

### Common Algorithms
- **Q-Learning**: Value-based learning
- **Policy Gradient**: Policy-based learning
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: Deep reinforcement learning

### Example Applications
- Game playing (AlphaGo, Chess)
- Autonomous vehicles
- Robotics
- Trading systems

## Choosing the Right Type

The choice depends on:
- **Data availability**: Do you have labeled data?
- **Problem type**: What are you trying to achieve?
- **Resources**: Computational and time constraints
- **Domain expertise**: Understanding of the problem
